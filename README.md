## Project Report
### Reflection
This was an annoying project to try to complete.  It isn't 100% finished, but it's playable.  I would probably have been able to do more if I hadn't gotten sick last month.  My favorite part was figuring out how to randomize the colors of the bottles in the bathroom.  I also enjoyed making the assets for cupboards and drawers.  I should get an A, barring any issues.
